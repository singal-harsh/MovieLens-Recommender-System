# MovieLens-Recommender-System

This repository shows a set of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating a variety of movie recommendation systems for the MovieLens 100K dataset from Kaggle (Link - https://www.kaggle.com/prajitdatta/movielens-100k-dataset). The dataset contain 100,000 ratings of approximately 1,682 movies made by 943 MovieLens users.

Here is the information related to different uploaded notebooks:

EDA: Loading and processing the users, movies, and ratings data with some exploratory data analysis graphs.

Content Based: Recommendation systems have been built using Correlation, Cosine Similarity and TFIDF approach.

Collaborative Filtering: Memory based (User based and Item based) and Model based (through Matrix Factorization/SVD) recommendation systems have been built.
